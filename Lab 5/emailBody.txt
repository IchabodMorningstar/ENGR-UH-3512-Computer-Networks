Subject: You can pick a different subject line if you like

I felt like using the Lorum Ipsum Generator thing but I decided
against it since:
    (a) I don't like reading gibberish
    (b) the lines get too long for no reason and
    (c) It's nicer to type out some silly text
.
You're not allowed to change this body text btw. So that dot on line 8? Yeah that can be a problem.
.Starting a line with a dot can also be a problem. Luckily, I was nice enough to point this out in...

...the lab manual so that you can look into it.
Enjoy.

Best,
Ahmad
